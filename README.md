Hey everyone, I’m Arnav Bhatia!
I’m interested in software development, data science, platform infrastructure, and IT.  
I am currently building scalable backend systems, improving cloud infrastructure, and designing robust deployment pipelines for enterprise clients. I’ve built ML deployment workflows, automated CI/CD pipelines, and re-architected systems to simplify access to thousands of microservices.  
I am currently diving deeper into platform engineering, learning about Kubernetes, Terraform, and observability tools to upskill myself. I am simultaneously preparing for multiple AI Engineer certifications.  
I am always happy to collaborate on open source projects and contribute back to the community. Please reach me anytime at arnav.cal@gmail.com... I’m quick to respond!
