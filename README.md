👋 Hi, I’m @arnavbhatia1  
👀 I’m interested in software development, data science, platform infrastructure, and IT.  
💡 Currently building scalable backend systems, improving cloud infrastructure, and designing robust deployment pipelines.  
✅ I’ve built ML deployment workflows, automated CI/CD pipelines, and re-architected systems to simplify access to thousands of microservices.  
🔭 I’m learning more about Kubernetes, Terraform, and observability tools to push my skills deeper into platform engineering.  
💞️ Always happy to collaborate on open source projects and contribute back to the community.
📫 Reach me anytime at arnav.cal@gmail.com — I’m quick to respond!
